function solvers = sapiListSolvers(connection)
%% SAPILISTSOLVERS List solvers available from a connection.
%
%  sapiListSolvers(connection)
%  solvers = sapiListSolvers(connection)
%
%  Input Parameters
%    connection: a connection handle, returned by either
%      sapiLocalConnection or sapiRemoteConnection.
%
%  Output
%    solvers: a cell array of solver names. If no output is specified, the
%      list of solver names is printed unquoted, one solver per line (for
%      ease of copying).
%
%  Solver names are used to acquire solver handles with the sapiSolver
%  function.
