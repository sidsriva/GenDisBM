function conn = sapiRemoteConnection(varargin)
%% SAPIREMOTECONNECTION Connect to remote SAPI solvers.
%
%  conn = sapiRemoteConnection(url, token)
%  conn = sapiRemoteConnection(url, token, proxy)
%
%  Input Parameters
%    url: SAPI URL. Get this from the web user interface (using the menu:
%      Developers > Solver API, "Connecting to SAPI" section).
%
%    token: API token. This is also obtained from the web user interface
%      (menu: <user id> > API tokens).
%
%    proxy: Proxy URL. By default (i.e. when no value or an empty matrix is
%      provided), MATLAB's proxy settings are used. If those settings are not
%      available, the environment variables all_proxy, http_proxy, and
%      https_proxy are checked (http_proxy and https_proxy are
%      protocol-specific, all_proxy is not). The environment variable
%      no_proxy is also examined; it can contain a comma-separated list of
%      hosts for which no proxy server should be used, or an asterisk to
%      override the other environment variables. If a proxy URL is given,
%      then it is used directly, without checking MATLAB's settings or any
%      environment variable. In particular, an empty string (i.e. '', which
%      is interpreted differently from []) forces no proxy server to be used.
%
%  Output
%    conn: handle to the remote connection. Do not rely on its internal
%      structure, it may change in future versions.
