function solver = sapiSolver(conn, solverName)
%% SAPISOLVER Get a solver handle.
%
%  solver = sapiSolver(conn, solverName)
%
%  Input Parameters
%    conn: a connection handle returned by sapiLocalConnection or
%      sapiRemoteConnection.
%
%    solverName: the name of the requested solver. Must be listed in
%      sapiListSolvers(conn).
%
%  Output
%    solver: a handle to the request solver.
%
%  Solver handles are required by sapiSolve* and sapiAsyncSolve* functions.
%
% Different solvers can take different parameters when used in solving ising/qubo problems.
%
% Hardware solver can take the following parameters:
%
%   annealing_time: a positive integer that sets the duration (in
%                   microseconds) of quantum annealing time.
%                   (must be an integer > 0, default = 1000)
%
%   answer_mode: indicates whether to return a histogram of answers,
%                sorted in order of energy ('histogram'); or to return all
%                answers individually in the order they were read ('raw').
%                (must be 'histogram' or 'raw', default = 'histogram')
%
%   auto_scale: indicates whether h and J values will be rescaled to use as
%               much of the range of h and the range of J as possible, or
%               be used as is. When enabled, h and J values need not lie
%               within the range of h and the range of J (but must still be
%               finite).
%               (must be a boolean value true or false, default = true)
%
%   max_answers: maximum number of answers returned from the solver in
%                histogram mode (which sorts the returned states in order
%                of increasing energy); this is the total number of distinct
%                answers. In raw mode, this limits the returned values to
%                the first max_answers of num_reads samples. Thus, in this
%                mode, max_answers should never be more than num_reads.
%                (must be an integer > 0, default = num_reads)
%
%   num_reads: a positive integer that indicates the number of states
%              (output solutions) to read from the solver in each programming
%              cycle. When a hardware solver is used, a programming cycle
%              programs the solver to the specified h and J values for a
%              given ising problem (or Q values for a given qubo problem).
%              However, since hardware precision is limited, the h and J
%              values (or Q values) realized on the solver will deviate
%              slightly from the requested values. On each programming cycle,
%              the deviation is random.
%              (must be an integer > 0, default = 1)
%
%   programming_thermalization: an integer that gives the time (in microseconds)
%                               to wait after programming the processor in order
%                               for it to cool back to base temperature (i.e.,
%                               post-programming thermalization time). Lower
%                               values will speed up solving at the expense
%                               of solution quality.
%                               (must be an integer > 0, default = 1000)
%
%   readout_thermalization: an integer that gives the time (in microseconds)
%                           to wait after each state is read from the processor
%                           in order for it to cool back to base temperature
%                           (i.e., post-readout thermalization time). Lower
%                           values will speed up solving at the expense of
%                           solution quality.
%                           (must be an integer > 0, deafult = 5)
