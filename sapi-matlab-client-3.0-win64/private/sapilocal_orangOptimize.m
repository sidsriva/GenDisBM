%sapilocal_orangOptimize Optimizing solver.
%   result = sapilocal_orangOptimize(problemType, problem, params)
%
%   problemType: 'ising' or 'qubo'.
%   problem: problem matrix.  For QUBO problems, this is the matrix Q for the
%     energy function is x'*Q*x.  For Ising problem this is the matrix
%     J+diag(h) for the energy function h'*s+s'*J*s.  Zeros are ignored and
%     the matrix need not be square.
%   params: a structure with the following fields (required unless noted):
%     num_vars: number of variables in the solution.
%     active_vars: vector of variable indices that may be used in problems.
%       Values are zero-based and therefore not equal to problem matrix
%       indices.
%     active_var_pairs: 2-by-N matrix of allowed variables in quadratic
%       terms.  Each column is a pair.  All entries must also appear in the
%       active_vars field.
%     var_order: variable elimination order.  Must be some permutation of the
%       unique entries in active_vars.
%     num_reads: number of lowest-energy solutions.
%     max_answers: maximum number of solutions to return.  In histogram mode,
%       this is the number of distinct solutions.  Otherwise, it behaves the
%       same as num_reads and the lesser value is used.
%     answer_histogram: logical value indicating whether or not to return
%       solutions as a histogram of distinct solutions.  This parameter is
%       provided for compatibility reasons.
%
%   result: a structure with fields:
%     energies: row vector of solution energies.  When the answer_histogram
%       parameter is true, this vector will be sorted in ascending order.
%     solutions: matrix of minimum-energy solutions.  Each column is a single
%       solution and its associated energy and count appear in the same
%       columns of the energies and num_occurrences fields, respectively.
%       Unused variables will have a value of 3.  Used variables will be
%       elements of {-1, +1} for Ising problems or {0, 1} for QUBO problems.
%     num_occurrences: number of occurrences of each solution.  Not present
%       unless answer_histogram is true (or in the trivial case when zero
%       solutions are requested).  All values are 1 except the first, which
%       is computed so that the sum equals num_reads.
